      <li><strong>Core 2 pillars of Stoicism:</strong> <strong>virtue</strong> (Ethics, courage, wisdom ...) and <strong>knowing what you can and you can't control</strong>.</li>

      <li>In this TedTalk, Ryan Holiday give many [stories]**[examples] about famous people been through their trouble and failure, and what the mindset they had when facing these trouble and failure. Compare to those hero, the obstacles we normal people facing are in fact really nothing and not comparable to what they had faced.</li>
      <li><strong>Notice</strong>, The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stoic Optimism</span> concept (by Ryan Holiday?) is not as same as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Optimism</span> solely, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Optimism</span> is the concept of having <strong>hope</strong> to <strong>future</strong>, and <strong>expect</strong> something good happens in future ; while <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stoic Optimism</span> is the concept of you <strong>don't care</strong> if the <strong>result is good or bad</strong> in the future, even you know it is bad and it will never be changed, you still be optimistic toward the current [situation]-[difficulty]. Think example of James Stockdale (he was a prisoner of war, in Vietnamese POW camp, for over seven years).</li>

(See the documentary video. it is more informative, he resist to "surrender" even he is under torture, in Vietnam communism land, and lead those captive (from US too) to against those communist).
