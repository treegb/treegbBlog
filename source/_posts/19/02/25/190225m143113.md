<li><strong>About:</strong> While Bootstrap can shape a site pretty fast by using it's monopoly (in both looking and feature) template, it is way too limited to adapt the various and customized requirement (for any reason). The advantage it can offers can't cover the disadvantage it cost, and in this case I think using vanilla css is better than using css framwork like Bootstrap. But front-end and back-end frameword is totally different story than this I think, and I will try to learn it.</li>
