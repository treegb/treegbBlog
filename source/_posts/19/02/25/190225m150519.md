  <li><strong>About:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/V-UvSKe8jW4">Link</a>. This video <strong>shock</strong> me a lot, it give me so much inspiration and hint and I finally know why I learned nothing in the past few years, I never repetition, I never organize my concepts nodes, I never think of "why", I never questioning and seek for opposite argument for what I just learned, I always forgot.</li>
  <li><strong>Why and when facts in short term memory can't convert to concept in long term memory:</strong> In short term memory you have facts, and if you want it to become concepts, you have to move it to long term memory. Without [attention]-[focus] (you eat up too many working memory chunks) and comprehension, this is not possible. And inevitable you will forget those facts.</li>
  <li><strong>Key quotes (subtitle) in video:</strong> Quote: --&lt; ... Second, see or hear others summarize the information, does not mean that you can make a summary or explain the argument ... I can probably tell the thoughts I have read or the random events, but if you really want to test me, ask me the story, ask me about the relevance of other theories, and then give examples, I can't answer this question ... I so often <strong>feel strongly about a position, but if I’m pressed, I could hardly argue for it</strong> ... A lot of modern media will make us don’t have to understand anything by ourselves ... and carefully selected data. It all amounts to a nice little package for the viewer to make up their own mind with little difficulty, except the packaging is often done so effectively that the viewer, <strong>listener or reader doesn't make up their own mind at all</strong> ... one of the many reasons why people have trouble explaining videos or books or articles is because <strong>they simply don't remember what was said</strong> ... in recent years we've discovered that <strong>long-term memory</strong> is the seat of understanding it stores <strong>not just facts but complex concepts or schemas</strong> ... <strong>short-term memory (working memory)</strong> ... the problem is what we hold there can quickly <strong>vanish</strong> if we don't keep thinking about them or rehearse them in our heads. In other words, <strong>if we don't grapple with the ideas</strong> in our working memory for an extended period of time, they <strong>never get sent to the long-term memory</strong>, they just disappear ... <strong>this is in part why I feel like I know so much, but understand so little</strong>. Why I can scroll down my twitter feed and <strong>barely remember any of it. Info jumps into my working memory, only to be replaced by the next thing, and the next thing, very little of it, if any, makes it into my long-term memory</strong> ... As Nicholas Carr writes as we reach the limits of our working memory, it becomes harder to distinguish relevant information from irrelevant information, signal from noise, we become mindless consumers of data ... <strong>multi-tasking ... recall ... feynman technique ... spaced repetition</strong> ... &gt;--.</li>
