    <li><strong>19-03-07 19:08 Defining "log::table" and "log::detail". Create first log table.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>19-03-07 19:13 Inspiration of "log table" come from:</strong> I think something give me inspiration to make <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> log table</span> is this <a href="https://youtu.be/olUVti4oyUA">link</a>, she mentioned she has no time to organize the content she type in here onenote, she just keep typing. It give me inspiration about I should do this with my log system too.</li>
    <li><strong>19-03-07 19:23 Playing with Draw.io:</strong> I started to read <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brave New World</span> again, then I was playing with concept map, then I started to build concept map for chapter 3, then I was comparing if I should use Inkscape or Draw.io to draw concept map. After carefully comparison, I chose Draw.io. Moving nodes (shapes) in inkscape is too damn time consuming compare with Draw.io. // (kw: drawIo).</li>
    <li><strong>19-03-07 20:13 Watching youtube:</strong> Keep watching youtube, like <a href="https://youtu.be/zntmeAs99-s">啾啾鞋</a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/z37SIZ3Q3rY">What Could Go Wrong - Instant regret Compilatio</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>19-03-07 20:55 Feeling sleepy now:</strong> I'm feeling sleepy, really nothing I can do, I don't want to watch youtube again. I go buy some drinks. I'm sleepy because I messed up my body sleep routine recently, I go to sleep around 06:00 yesterday.</li>
    <li><strong>19-03-07 21:04 Decide I have to keep moving:</strong> I have to keep reading the book (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brave New World</span>), the time is passing, I just have to overcome this tired what ever, otherwise basically do nothing today.</li>
    <li><strong>19-03-07 21:53 Watching youtube:</strong> Feeling very low productivity when reading the book, I just don't have enough energy to read, too sleepy.</li>
    <li><strong>19-03-07 23:54 Searching online svg editor:</strong> Searching if there is any useful online svg editor, <strong>with no good reason</strong> (just because watched youtube video about online drawing tools). And finally I found there is nothing better then inkscape, inkscape is the most robust tool in the all, research done, no need to do further research in the future (unless you can't install inkscape in some special working place).</li>
    <li><strong>19-03-08 01:33 Designing concept map:</strong> When I'm in shower, I was thinking about the problem concept map has, in natural. A concept map is build by multiple pieces of [ concept ]-[ node ], and connected by connect phase. Sometimes this is fine, if distanced 2 [ concept ]-[ node ] that is not neighbor to each other, are not in same context, but if those [ concept ]-[ node ] are in same context, it cause a bit confusing, and more worse, if you have multiple context rely on same [ concept ]-[ node ], they fight together, and causing reader confused about the context. To solve this, I bring the context id (number) into the connector (connect phase), so reader can easily distinguish 2 things: 1. When reader see the number, they know there must be the bigger context, across multiple [ concepts ]-[ node ], only when reader pass through multiple [ concepts ]-[ node ] then they could <strong>understand the whole context</strong>. 2. Reader can distinguish different context even the [ concept ]-[ node ] are <strong>shared</strong> (same [ concept ]-[ node ] are used multiple times for different context), and close to each other.</li>
    <li><strong>19-03-08 03:02 Found subReddit "/r/ICanDrawThat":</strong> Cool, I hope same thing could happens on programming, where people enthusiastic for offering their programming skills, can meet people request someone can use programming to solve their problem. // (Kw: reddit).</li>

Current conclusion is, there is no good alternative, the biggest good alternative (but even though they are still having relative small user base) is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diaspora</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">minds.com</span>, which both care about privacy. // Reddit is good, but reddit is not good for putting self content, it is community based, not personal based, this is why I'm finding social media alternative, other than Reddit.</li>

After watching this documentary, I even have stronger feel this about this (I thought this before) - everything is meaningless, it all up to you how you give the meaning to anything, <strong>people can chose to feel bored or fun in the jail</strong>. If you feel like something is meaningful, it is, vice versa. We can create meaning, <strong>out from empty</strong>, we can create our own game in our lifetime.</li>

    <li><strong>19-03-12 15:10 Designing concept map, is [ html ]-[ text ] version possible?:</strong> I'm thinking about use html webpage (pure text) to implement concept map. I will try to exploit the "ul,,li" elements.</li>
    <li><strong>19-03-12 19:50 Finished designing concept map,, node,, reverse indexing system?:</strong> Ok, problem solved, now I extract those "heavy nodes", outside to new svg image, and use "inverse indexing" to make some [ "backlink" ]-[ connection ] back to original nodes, so both "linking" direction works (there is no any [ html ]-[ href ] linking, the linking I mention here is visually only, so even export to jpg, it works too), and with [ reverse indexing ]-[ backlink ], now I have build stronger connection in my brain of these related concepts, in any [ direction ]**[ viewpoint ].</li>

    <li><strong>19-03-13 09:00 Making concept map on { Minds }:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/mJowz_-pj4U">Joe Rogan Experience #1248 - Bill Ottman</a>. At first I just want to do concept map for fun, but out of my expect, it consume me more than 1 day and I feel like the content don't worth the detail concept map like this (rich concept map). But at least, with this <strong>"real data"</strong>, I now have better system (concept map) to handle complex data, and my style change a lot.</li>
    <li><strong>19-03-14 14:20 Morning wake up.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>19-03-14 20:20 Finished { Minds },, concept map.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>19-03-15 16:35 Keep reading book:</strong> Brave New World, chapter 9. Listen to <a href="https://youtu.be/eceHIDmO28o">music</a> in background, though I know this is bad idea, because I can't really focus on story.</li>
    <li><strong>19-03-15 20:35 Dinner:</strong> Brave New World, reading process to half of chapter 10. I spent some time on tweaking concept map again. Taking shower and cooking dinner.</li>
    <li><strong>19-03-16 12:15 Morning wake up.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>19-03-16 12:40 Keep reading book:</strong> Brave New World, chapter 10. Including carefully and slowly designing "context scope numbering" system in concept map (e.g. <code>{ node under context 7} -- 7: connecting text --&gt; { node under context 7 and 8 } -- (7)8: connecting text --&gt; { node under context 8 } -- 8: connecting text --&gt; { node under context 8 }</code> ).</li>

    <li><strong>19-03-17 08:25 Making note:</strong> Brave New World, chapter 11. I feel like I've spent too much time on drawing concept map, I spent too much time adjusting unimportant visual stuff. Typing text is way faster than organizing the concept map. But at least, for reader standpoint, concept map is a lot easier than text to read, especially the first time, they don't know the huge story at before, then in this circumstances, concept map will have more advantage.</li>

    <li><strong>19-03-18 11:45 Sleep:</strong> Finished the note of Brave New World, chapter 12. The reason I spent so much time is because I always try to condense the story into small piece of concept map structure, though this is not necessary. It is playful and challenging (when the logic is sophisticated and works in all direction, but only few nodes and connections needed), honestly, this is one of the reason why I doing this, instead of story itself.</li>

    <li><strong>19-03-20 10:10 Morning wake up:</strong> I fall asleep very late, so I get up late too. I was thinking about if I can turn all <span style="text-decoration: underline;">log table</span> into concept map form.</li>
    <li><strong>19-03-20 10:25 Experimenting with "visual" log table:</strong> I fall asleep very late last night, because I was thinking about if I can turn all <span style="text-decoration: underline;">log table</span> into concept map form, like a clock, split 360 degree with 24 slices, each slice  represent a hour. And I draw concept map (to express a log record) based on what I was doing with those individual hours ... After a month, I draw another map, split 360 degree with 30 (or 31) slices, each slice represent a day, [ log down ]-[ showing ] the important things I done in these 30 (or 31) days.</li>
    <li><strong>19-03-20 14:45 Convert { log table },, text form to { concept map }, no longer update it in Joomla side:</strong> I take serious about should I convert my { log table } to { concept map }? It is so hard to decide, since I don't know if it is realistic in long run. Concept Map is easiy to grasp concepts and find keywords, but very time consuming to make. Hard to navigate with mobile devices that only has tiny screen. You have to open each image one by one individually. You can't search on concept map, the hyper links don't work (svg do support hyper line, but for compatibility reason I better not use it). // The biggest advantage of concept map is, normal text on webpage is too "enegy consuming" to read, in the end my log table will have records in full month (amount), that might be around 30 ~ 150 records, and who (including me) will every want to read that? Visually form presentation (concept map) solve this problem, it reduce cognitive load and those logs will still have value (to look back) in the future, simply because it is easier and more enjoyable to read. // Another advantage is, it is mor fun to make concept map, and I think it will subconsciously influence how you [ value ]-[ spend ] your time (instead of wasting it), if you represent it with visual form.</li>

        <li><strong>Personality and skills require of being a pilot (or astronauts? leader?):</strong>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Mental quality (this is most important I think)</strong>, include very good rational ability (to follow all SOP), able to resist over many times of failure, able to endure pressure, able to endure long term boring learning, practice, training before any real flight.</li>
            <li>Smart and can grasp everything in real time all in head (leader, commander).</li>
            <li>English.</li>
            <li>Physical strength (only jet pilot require this).</li>
            <li>Memorizing all cockpit position (blindfolded test) and code name (abbreviation) without any error, any error is intolerable.</li>
            <li>Have very well understanding of all procedures, takeoff plans, communication with tower, numbers and calculation, geography, climate, plane itself (including landing technique) ... just know every detal of <strong>every aspect</strong> of the whole system related to flight. Same again, any error is intolerable.</li>
            <li>When it comes to safty, any error is intolerable. The testing score of a pilot is always with either 100 or 0, never something in between, this is due to the absolute safty require of flight.</li>
            <li><strong>Only</strong> all previous requirement are fulfilled, than a pilot can <strong>starts to enjoy the real joy</strong> of flight, otherwise, they don't get it. This might be the same in every fields, the real joy only comes after ones reach certain hight of bar.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>SOP and modularized everything:</strong> For safty and efficiency reason, they SOP and modularized everything, even include very small detail like <a href="https://youtu.be/2JsqCOHAc9I?t=2132">turning the direction on the air</a> (They request the <code>ATC</code> (air traffic control) twice, not once, for the minor flight direction (orientation) change, I guess it is because the ATC have to control many plane at the same time, the most safe system is, by breaking each movement of a plane, to pieces, every movement is irrelevance, so they <strong>can predict</strong> (and have control)). This makes me think about <code>coherence</code> and <code>couple</code> in <strong>programming</strong>, we always make components <a href="http://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/dependency-injection-is-evil.html#cohesion">have high coherence and low couple as possible</a>, to deal with very complex system that even we can only understand a small piece at a time.</li>

The correct solution is just build up a Web App, and use <strong>tags</strong> (or even better <strong><code>facets</code></strong>) to store, organize files and search with specific dimension inside these multi-dimension information files.</li>
    <li><strong>{ Energy Level } in art:</strong>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>I think I start to learn somthing:</strong> I think I start to learn somthing from content related to art, it seems all <strong>art</strong> (music, <a href="https://youtu.be/7jKGRg2mlXo?t=2122">dance</a>, drawing, animation ...) has at least these 2 <strong>essence</strong> - { 1. Balance between unpredictable and predictable. 2. In every individual specific case there are only specific "level" you can (should) use, just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_level">Energy Level</a> in chemistry (though I know nothing about it). Example such as <code>Note Value</code> in music, spacing and font size in typography, color using in graphic design ... }.</li>
      <li><strong>When { Energy Level } rise and drops:</strong> I often found in every art piece, when "lower level" rise to "higher level", it rise <strong>fast and crisp</strong>, the level <strong>never stays in between, or slow and mild</strong>, otherwise it will ruin the art piece very fast. When "higher level" drops to "lower level", it also drops fast and crisp and the level never stays in between.</li>
      <li><strong>Some example:</strong> For example, the <code>Note Value</code> (or <code>Note Duration</code>) in <a href="https://youtu.be/x_OwcYTNbHs?t=43">music</a>, the Note Value raise from "1/2" to "1/4" to "1/8" to "1/16" ... (in reality something like "3/8" is possible, but that is not my point here). For example in <code>typography</code>, the font size (or spacing) in lower level might be 0.0625em, 0.125em, when it rise to higher level, it rise directly up to 0.9em, 1em, 1.2em, when it rise again, it might be something like 4.6em, 5em, never something in between. For example <code>color theory</code> in web design, in theory you can use as many color as you want, there is 6,000,000 of colors you can pick freely for your webpage, but in reality, you shouldn't use too much color, you should only use like 3 ~ 4 of them for most, you might use <span style="background-color: #e1d199ff ; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)">this color</span>, or <span style="background-color: #bbd68b ; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)">this color</span>, or <span style="background-color: #461b1b ; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)">this color</span>, but never <span style="background-color: #4762f7 ; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)">this color</span>. There is just many "Energy Level" can't be used.</li>

        <li><strong>Focus your attention on one thing at a time:</strong> [ Book ]-{ The One Thing }-{ Gary Keller }.</li>
        <li><strong>They focus on making small, continuous improvements:</strong> Henry Ford once said, “Nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small pieces.” The same concept configured as a question:  How do you eat an elephant?  Answer: One bite at a time.  This philosophy holds true for achieving your biggest goals.  Making small, positive changes – eating a little healthier, exercising a little, creating some small productive habits, for example – is an amazing way to get excited about life and slowly reach the level of success you aspire to.</li>
        <li><strong>They avoid the trap of trying to make things perfect:</strong> --{ Remember, the real world doesn’t reward perfectionists.  It rewards people who get things done.  And the only way to get things done is to be imperfect 99% of the time.  Only by wading through years of practice and imperfection can we begin to achieve momentary glimpses of the perfection. }--, --{ The simple act of getting started and doing something will give you the momentum you need, and soon you’ll find yourself in a positive spiral of changes – one building on the other. }--.</li>
        <li><strong>They keep things simple:</strong> --{ Several business and marketing studies have shown that the more product choices a consumer is faced with, the less products they typically buy.  After all, narrowing down the best product from a pool of three choices is certainly a lot easier than narrowing down the best product from a pool of three hundred choices.  If the purchasing decision is tough to make, most people will just give up.  Likewise, if you complicate your life by inundating yourself with too many choices, your subconscious mind will give up. }--, --{ If you’re trying to make a decision about something in your life, don’t waste all your time evaluating every last detail of every possible option.  Choose something that you think will work and give it a shot.  If it doesn’t work out, learn what you can from the experience, choose something else and keep pressing forward. }--.</li>
        <li><strong>They measure and track their progress.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>They spend time with the right people (and things that have value).</strong></li>
        <li><strong>They maintain balance in their life:</strong> --{ Typically they’ll achieve one or two of them while completely neglecting the rest.  Let me give you two examples: ... I know an extremely savvy businesswoman who made almost a million dollars online last year ... }--.</li>

      <li><strong>Hoisting:</strong> I suddenly have my mind clicked, <code>Hoisting</code> is noting to do with moving the line <code>var theVarName</code> up to before the line <code>theVarName = "a new value"</code>, but it is all about the allocate the memory space and assign default value for the variable <code>theVarName</code> first (<code>Creation Phase</code> of that <code>Execution Context</code>), then later (the next step) (<code>Execution Phase</code> of that <code>Execution Context</code>) is assign the value <code>"a new value"</code> to <code>theVarName</code>.</li>
      <li><strong>17:47:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/Nt-qa_LlUH0?t=1067">Link</a>. Visualizer shows when function,, <code>Execution Context</code> don't found the variable user want to use, it goes up to parent (in this case global context) to see the variable in same name, it it exists then use it instead.
